\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class lm}

\item{clustid}{A character vector containing the names of the cluster variables}

\item{B}{Integer. The number of bootstrap iterations. When the number of clusters is low,
increasing B adds little additional runtime.}

\item{R}{Hypothesis Vector or Matrix giving linear combinations of coefficients. Must be either a vector of length k or a matrix of dimension q x k, where q is the number
of joint hypotheses and k the number of estimated coefficients.}

\item{beta0}{A vector of length q, where q is the number of tested hypotheses. Shifts the null hypothesis
H0: param = beta0 vs H1: param != beta0. If not provided, a vector of zeros of length q.}

\item{bootcluster}{A character vector. Specifies the bootstrap clustering variable or variables. If more
than one variable is specified, then bootstrapping is clustered by the intersections of
clustering implied by the listed variables. To mimic the behavior of stata's boottest command,
the default is to cluster by the intersection of all the variables specified via the \code{clustid} argument,
even though that is not necessarily recommended (see the paper by Roodman et al cited below, section 4.2).
Other options include "min", where bootstrapping is clustered by the cluster variable with the fewest clusters.}

\item{conf_int}{A logical vector. If TRUE, boottest computes confidence
intervals by p-value inversion. If FALSE, only the p-value is returned.}

\item{rng}{An integer. Controls the random number generation, which is handled via the \code{StableRNG()} function from the \code{StableRNGs} Julia package.}

\item{sign_level}{A numeric between 0 and 1 which sets the significance level
of the inference procedure. E.g. sign_level = 0.05
returns 0.95\% confidence intervals. By default, sign_level = 0.05.}

\item{type}{character or function. The character string specifies the type
of boostrap to use: One of "rademacher", "mammen", "norm", "gamma"
and "webb". Alternatively, type can be a function(n) for drawing
wild bootstrap factors. "rademacher" by default.
For the Rademacher and Mammen distribution, if the number of replications B exceeds
the number of possible draw ombinations, 2^(#number of clusters), then \code{boottest()}
will use each possible combination once (enumeration).}

\item{impose_null}{Logical. Controls if the null hypothesis is imposed on
the bootstrap dgp or not. Null imposed \code{(WCR)} by default.
If FALSE, the null is not imposed \code{(WCU)}}

\item{p_val_type}{Character vector of length 1. Type of p-value.
By default "two-tailed". Other options include "equal-tailed", ">" and "<".}

\item{tol}{Numeric vector of length 1. The desired accuracy
(convergence tolerance) used in the root finding procedure to find the confidence interval.
Relative tolerance of 1e-6 by default.}

\item{na_omit}{Logical. If TRUE, \code{boottest()} omits rows with missing
variables in the cluster variable that have not previously been deleted
when fitting the regression object (e.g. if the cluster variable was not used
when fitting the regression model).}

\item{floattype}{Float32 by default. Other optio: Float64. Should floating point numbers in Julia be represented as 32 or 64 bit?}

\item{fweights}{Logical. FALSE by default, TRUE for frequency weights.}

\item{getauxweights}{Logical. FALSE by default. Whether to save auxilliary weight matrix (v)}

\item{t_boot}{Logical. Should bootstrapped t-statistics be returned?}

\item{turbo}{Logical scalar, FALSE by default. Whether to exploit acceleration of the LoopVectorization package: slower on first use in a session, faster after}

\item{maxmatsize}{NULL by default = no limit. Else numeric scalar to set the maximum size of auxilliary weight matrix (v), in gigabytes}

\item{bootstrapc}{Logical scalar, FALSE by default. TRUE  to request bootstrap-c instead of bootstrap-t}

\item{ssc}{An object of class \code{boot_ssc.type} obtained with the function \code{\link[fwildclusterboot]{boot_ssc}}. Represents how the small sample adjustments are computed. The defaults are \verb{adj = TRUE, fixef.K = "none", cluster.adj = "TRUE", cluster.df = "conventional"}.
You can find more details in the help file for \code{boot_ssc()}. The function is purposefully designed to mimic fixest's \code{\link[fixest]{ssc}} function.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{waldtest}

\item{p_val}{The bootstrap p-value.}
\item{conf_int}{The bootstrap confidence interval.}
\item{param}{The tested parameter.}
\item{N}{Sample size. Might differ from the regression sample size if the
cluster variables contain NA values.}
\item{B}{Number of Bootstrap Iterations.}
\item{clustid}{Names of the cluster Variables.}
\item{N_G}{Dimension of the cluster variables as used in boottest.}
\item{sign_level}{Significance level used in boottest.}
\item{type}{Distribution of the bootstrap weights.}
\item{t_stat}{The original test statistics - either imposing the null or not - with small sample correction \code{G / (G-1)}.}
\item{test_vals}{All t-statistics calculated while calculating the
confidence interval.}
\item{t_boot}{All bootstrap t-statistics.}
\item{regression}{The regression object used in boottest.}
\item{call}{Function call of boottest.}
\item{getauxweights}{The bootstrap auxiliary weights matrix v. Only returned if getauxweights = TRUE.}
\item{t_boot}{The bootstrapped t-statistics. Only returned if t_boot = TRUE.}

\code{waldtest.lm} is a S3 method that allows for fast wild cluster
bootstrap inference of multivariate hypotheses for objects of class lm by
implementing the fast wild bootstrap algorithm developed in Roodman et al., 2019.
