\title{boot_ssc() handles the small sample correction factor applied in boottest() in
analogy to fixest::ssc()}
\usage{
boot_ssc(
  adj = TRUE,
  fixef.K = "none",
  cluster.adj = TRUE,
  cluster.df = "conventional"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster.adj}{Logical scalar, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, a cluster correction G/(G-1) is performed, with G the number of clusters.}

\item{cluster.df}{Either "conventional" or "min" default. Controls how "G" is computed for multiway clustering if cluster.adj = TRUE. Note that the covariance matrix in the multiway clustering case is of the form V = V_1 + V_2 - V_12. If "conventional", then each summand G_i is multiplied with a small sample adjustment G_i / (G_i - 1). If "min", all summands are multiplied with the same value, min(G) / (min(G) - 1)}

\item{adj.}{Logical scalar, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, applies a small sample correction of (N-1) / (N-k) where N is the number of observations and k is the number of estimated coefficients excluding any fixed effects projected out in either fixest::feols() or lfe::felm().}

\item{fixef.k}{Character scalar, equal to 'none': the fixed effects parameters are discarded when calculating k in (N-1) / (N-k).}
